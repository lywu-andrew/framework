One of the most underrated student bodies in the country in terms of intellect. Overall impression is that this is one of the best schools in the country to focus on academics and be thrown into interdisciplinary study. Every student at Carnegie Mellon chooses a specific major in one of the 7 colleges and is required to minor in a college other than the one they are majoring in. This makes every student on campus have a really specific knowledge in their major and an often unrelated and multidisciplinary edge due to the minor requirement. CMU is a great school for students who know what they want before they get to college.
