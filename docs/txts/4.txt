This school is definitely a weird place to be. But the key thing to remember is that everyone here knows the stereotypes of this school, which makes CMU an easy place to fit in. The school is pretty small, so you'll always see at least two friends on the way to class and back. But one unique thing about this school is the social-awkwardness that is definitely present across many students, including myself sometimes. CMU sort of makes you self-conscious of introversion, and pushes you to become more outgoing. It also teaches you to be proud of your quirks, since it's easy to find one or two other people that are into the same hobby or weird thing you're into.
