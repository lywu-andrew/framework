# Experience Report

The framework-providing team provided good documentation for how to use their framework, implement plugins, and run the plugins.

To implement the data plugins, we did not need any additional support from the framework team. When implementing the visualization plugin, we weren't familiar with Svelte and encountered a small issue involving promises. We submitted an issue on the framework repo, but figured out the issue shortly after posting. Thus, we didn't need any additional help on the visualization plugin either.
